                    <p> Learning web development is a new journey for me. I have always loved computers and learning how they work but when it comes to web development this is all new to me. I am 23 years old, and a recent graduate of the University of Delaware. I graduated in December of 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Sociology. Following my graduation I began to work for a national school reform company that focus on re-engaging high school dropouts. I was an a recruitment and engagement officer.</p>
                    <p>I have currently work for the tech side of that company. I am currently helping with testing new features and assisting the developers with anything they may need help with on their project.</p>
                    <p> I have a 1 year old bernedoodle named Lily, that is her picture to the left. She is full of energy and loves attention and treats! I am also an guitarist (13 and a half years under my belt so far). I also love writing, playing video games and hanging with my close buddies.</p>
